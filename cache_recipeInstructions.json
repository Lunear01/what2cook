Next add the tomato, onion, cilantro, serrano chiles, olive \noil, and some salt to the bowl. Stir well. Your ceviche is \nnow prepared, it just needs time to marinate.

If you must make and serve it on the \nsame day, just be sure it is  refrigerated at least 4 hours \nbefore serving.\n4. To serve the ceviche, place it in a serving bowl with \ntostadas or tortilla chips on the side. You can spoon the \nceviche on the tostadas, or dip the chips if you prefer. If \nyou want, wedges of avocado make a nice garnish. Your \nceviche will be chilled, fresh, and delicious.
